/*
 * Interpolate.h
 *
 * Provide a better way to insert args into strings, replacing printf-style mechanisms.
 *
 * Although printf-style functions are great workhorses, they have important weaknesses:
 *
 *   - Some of them are not threadsafe.
 *   - Varargs can be (and often are) misused in ways that cause seg faults.
 *   - They don't provide any help in rendering objects.
 *   - Arg references cannot be reordered or repeated, which is problematic in
 *     localization.
 *   - It's easy to forget which semantics attach to a particular arg ("Was this '%s'
 *     the filename or the folder?")
 *
 * The interpolate() function solves these problems while remaining fast and easy to use.

// The general form of interpolate takes many args. However, in most cases we'll only be passing

// of useless pointers with every call to interpolate(). I put them first in the file so you can

 *               and names for args can be added with a {...} suffix. For example, if
 *               your second arg is a floating-point angle between 0 and 90 degrees,
 *               you could refer to it as "@2{angle:%.1f}", which would render it with
 *               a single digit after the decimal point, and tell any coder using it
