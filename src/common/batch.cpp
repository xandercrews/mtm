/**
 * How much will we read from a batch file at any given time?
 *
 * Don't set this too high -- we want to be able to run multiple batches in
 * parallel, so we may have multiples of this class active at the same time.
 * Besides, past experience with file I/O shows that as long as you're reading
 * large chunks (say, >256 k), the performance doesn't change much as the
 * number grows. This is because files are often fragmented on disk, or are
 * read from the network inefficiently -- so asking for ever larger chunks of
 * them just shifts the burden of managing head movement and caching back to
 * the kernel and network I/O layers, without changing the speed, and with
 * significant increases in RAM requirements. Since we have to handle chunking
 * inside our code anyway (to cope with batch file sizes in the tens or
 * hundreds of gigabytes), the tradeoff doesn't make sense.
