/**
 * Provide support for "design by contract", which allows functions to declare
 * preconditions and postconditions, and guarantee that they're enforced.
 *
 * DBC is similar in concept to assertions, but it is designed to be used in
 * release builds, and it's a bit more helpful about reporting what goes
 * wrong in a way that the application can handle flexibly. See
 * http://www.eiffel.com/developers/design_by_contract.html for DBC theory.

/**
 * Define what should happen when a contract is violated. By default, we
 * throw an exception. Other possibilities might include calling exit(1) with
 * a message on stderr, emitting a special message to the message queue, etc.
 * Ignoring contract violations is a recipe for disaster and should NEVER be
 * the choice, because every contract violation is a coding error that causes
 * downstream code to produce undefined results. Better to bail out as soon as
 * we recognize a problem, rather than let a blind maniac pilot the plane and
 * hope we land without hurting ourselves or others.
