/*
 * interp.h
 *
 * Provide a better way to insert args into strings, replacing printf-style
 * mechanisms.
 *
 * Although printf-style functions are great workhorses, they have important
 * weaknesses:
 *
 *   - Some of them are not threadsafe.
 *   - Varargs can be (and often are) misused in ways that cause seg faults.
 *   - They don't provide any help in rendering objects.
 *   - Arg references cannot be reordered or repeated, which is problematic in
 *     localization.
 *   - It's easy to forget which semantics attach to a particular arg ("Was
 *     this '%s' the filename or the folder?")
 *
 * The interp() function family solves these problems while remaining fast and
 * easy to use.
 *
 * This module also provides macros to make other functions (e.g., logging,
 * exception ctors) interpolation-compatible -- sort of like the varargs
 * mechanism in C.
