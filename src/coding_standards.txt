The most important standards to use in this codebase are the so-called "big 5":

1. expressive names
2. documented preconditions, errors, and vital knowledge
3. developer tests
4. adequate error handling
5. reasonable size for functions, files, and classes

See https://wiki.ac:8443/display/ENG/Coding+Habits for more info about these.

In addition, there are some stylistic rules that we'd like to encourage, in
order of descending priority.

a. Encapsulate.

   This makes a huge difference to the learnability and long-term maintenance
   cost of the code. You do it by using interfaces, NEVER having public or
   protected members, using abstract factories, etc.

b. Prefer C++ 11 headers and mechanisms.

   This means you should use std::thread instead of pthreads, std::mutex instead
   of pthread_mutex_t, std::atomic, std::chrono, std::regex, etc. The main
   benefit of this is that this keeps us insulated from *nix-specific C-isms. A
   secondary benefit is that it raises the general level of sophistication of
   our team with respect to C++. (There are a few exceptions; std streams and
   locales have never been widely accepted, so a good old FILE * is fine...)
   
c. With great discipline, use std::unique_ptr and scope_guard to implement RAII.  

d. Use #includes that are relative to the ./src folder. This makes it very
   clear where a particular file comes from, and how internal packages depend
   on one another.
   
e. Prefer static linking.
   
f. Avoid pre/suffixes that just clutter the code without a meaningful increase
   in the semantic payload of a name. (The *_t suffix is an exception; we use
   it for classes and enums that just hold data, so that we can have variables
   that use the same name without the suffix.) 
   
g. Maintain conventions on capitalization, indenting, and naming that are
   already active in the codebase. These conventions reflect the way the STL
   is named, formatted, and written.
